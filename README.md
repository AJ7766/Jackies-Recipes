# About the Project
- I developed a comprehensive full-stack social platform called Jackies Recipes, enabling users to store, share and discover recipes. This project showcases my ability to design scalable and maintainable applications by incorporating the Container-Service-Repository (CSR) pattern in the backend for API endpoints, ensuring future scalability for advanced features. While most data fetching is optimized using Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO, I implemented the Dumb-Smart Components design pattern on the client side to maintain a clear separation of presentation and logic - enhancing reusability and maintainability. The project blends these approaches to deliver an engaging, well-optimized and responsive user experience.

# Summary of Work in This Project
- Developed the application using TypeScript with Next.js for SSR and Node.js for backend logic.
- Designed API endpoints using the CSR pattern, prioritizing scalable and maintainable backend architecture for future app expansion.
- Optimized data fetching for initial page loads using Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to enhance performance and SEO.
- Built the frontend using the Dumb-Smart Components design pattern, ensuring a clear separation of presentation and logic for reusability, scalability and maintainability.
- Utilized MongoDB for data storage with Mongoose for schema modeling and interaction.
- Implemented secure user authorization using Server-Side Cookies with Iron-Session and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Boosted performance by implementing caching - Node-cache in the backend for faster queries and frontend caching for efficient rendering.
- Conducted integration and unit testing with Jest to ensure code quality, reliability and maintainability.
- Implemented Client-Side Cookies for user consent management.
- Utilized Tailwind CSS for responsive design and styling.
- Implemented key features: user registration, login, secure access control with Iron-Session and JWT, cookie consent, profile editing, recipe management (add, edit, delete), and search functionality for users and recipes.
